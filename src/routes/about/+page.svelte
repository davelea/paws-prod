        <p />
        Established in 2014 by me, Becky Lea, Paws Around Motown offers mobile services to fit into your
        busy lifestyle! We come to you and offer dog walking, pet sitting, obedience training, pet taxis,
        and yard cleanups all around Oakland County.
        <p />
        This company and the customers we serve is everything to me and I am dedicated to offering positive
        reinforcement pet services by people who love animals as much as I do. What started out with
        me, with one dog, and a dream has flourished and grown 350 customers strong with 20 pet sitters.
        <p />
        Every Pet is different and we pride ourselves on knowing each pet as an individual and developing
        a care plan suited for each individual. What makes them tick, what do they like, what do they
        not like. We love all animals, all breeds, all shapes and all sizes. Love does not discriminate.
